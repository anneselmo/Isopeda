ISOPEDA

Isopeda is a set of python3 tools that work together to scan through sets of
webpages (such as output from my related project at:

https://github.com/anneselmo/Salticus.scenicus ).

Mainly it was designed with news articles in mind, but doubtless could be used
on other sorts of content. 

It uses multiple utilities from nltk, in addition to BeautifulSoup, cdbx, and
python magic. If you're setting it up, you may also need to download the nltk
stopwords database, such as by opening a python3 shell and running:

import nltk 
nltk.download('stopwords')

presently one can generate a training set with sets.py, and feed that to
functions in classi.py to produce and save a classifier, which then gets used
by isopeda.py's isopeda function to read through databases and produce some
hopefully desired items.

Enjoy!
