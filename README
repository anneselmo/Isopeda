ISOPEDA

Isopeda is a set of python3 tools that work together to scan through sets of
webpages (such as output from my related project at:

https://github.com/anneselmo/Salticus.scenicus ).

Mainly it was designed with news articles in mind, but doubtless could be used
on other sorts of content. 

It uses multiple utilities from nltk, in addition to BeautifulSoup, cdbx, and
python magic.

Isopeda depends on a few python3 modules: 

-nltk
 (natural language processing toolkit)
-cdbx 
 (python implementation of https://cr.yp.to/cdb.html )
-python magic
 (for infering file types)
-beautifulsoup4
 (html parsing)
-requests
  (web downloads)

it also uses the nltk english stopwords from nltk, which can be obtained by
running the following in a shell:

import nltk 
nltk.download('stopwords')

In order to actually do a run, you need to setup a few things first: a
classifier, category weights, and a keywords list. 

As I am still sorting out how best to handle setting up a classifier, I am
leaving it at that for now.

Enjoy!
